🏦 Indian ATM Machine – Logic Gate Simulation (DLCO Project)

This project is a web-based simulation of an Indian ATM Machine designed as part of a DLCO (Digital Logic & Computer Organization) academic project. It demonstrates how digital logic gates such as XNOR, AND, and OR are used internally to validate ATM operations.

The system simulates real-world ATM functionalities including PIN verification, cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, deposit, and exit operations, while clearly displaying the logic expressions and gate-level decisions behind each step.

🔑 Key Features

PIN verification using XNOR logic gate

Withdrawal, deposit, and balance check using AND & OR gates

Console-style interactive UI

Card blocking after 3 wrong PIN attempts

Real-time balance updates

Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation

Beginner-friendly and educational

🧠 Logic Gates Used

XNOR Gate → PIN authentication

AND Gate → Transaction authorization

OR Gate → Final transaction validation
